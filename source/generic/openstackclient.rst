OpenStackClient
===============

OpenStackClient (aka OSC) is a command-line client for OpenStack that brings the command set for Compute, Identity, Image, Object Store and Block Storage APIs together in a single shell with a uniform command structure. [#s1]_

.. note::

   Possibly release names (e.g. ``pike``) are already obsolete. Then just use the current release.

   An overview of OpenStack releases can be found at https://releases.openstack.org/.

Ubuntu
======

1. Add latest Ubuntu Cloud Archive (UCA) repository: ``sudo add-apt-repository cloud-archive:pike`` (``add-apt-repository`` is part of the package ``software-properties-common``)
2. Install ``python-openstackclient``: ``sudo apt-get install python-openstackclient``

.. note::

   The package ``python-openstackclient`` does not install all OpenStack Python client libraries as dependencies. Install these manually if plugins are missing/not usable in ``python-openstackclient``, e.g.```sudo apt-get install python-heatclient`` to be able to use the Heat plugin.

Pip
===

1. Create and activate a virtual environment: ``virtualenv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`` (``virtualenv`` is part of the package ``virtualenv``)
2. Install the latest released version of ``python-openstackclient``: ``pip install python-openstackclient``

.. note::

   The installed dependencies require the installation of additional development packages, such as ``pyhton-dev`` on Ubuntu.

.. note::

   An installation of the master branch is also possible: ``pip install git+https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient``
